#Welcome Hello World!
This site has been created to test the possibility of having non-web savvy users edit and manage a website by themselves. initially it doesn't seem like a great idea, but I do believe in the common man.

That being said, I know that the common man sometimes forgets his common sense. When editing the website, the users will need to
*Edit Text (duh)
*Embed pictures
*Embed links
*Embed photos
*Re-arrange formatting

Whether or not this will be possible with Markdown alone is yet to be seen.
