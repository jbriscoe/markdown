#Welcome Hello World!
This site has been created to test the possibility of having non-web savvy users edit and manage a website by themselves. initially it doesn't seem like a great idea, but I do believe in the common man.

That being said, I know that the common man sometimes forgets his common sense. When editing the website, the users will need to
* Edit Text (duh)
* [Embed pictures] (pictures.md)
* [Embed links] (links.md) 
* [Embed videos] (videos.md)
* [Re-arrange formatting] (advanced.md)

Whether or not this will be possible with Markdown alone is yet to be seen.
